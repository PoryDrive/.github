PoryDrive is a simple game I have designed so that I can experiment applying different Neural Networks and Machine Learning models to see what the result will be.

One of my main goals in this project is to see if I can train a neural network to infer the existance of obsticles without being explicity told about them in the training data, that from just the delay in reaching a goal could cause an agent to avoid them without explicitly knowing about them.
